      "description": "I currently run a program that uses Jupiter V6 Swap API to execute token swaps on the Solana blockchain. The program works by first fetching a quote for the given parameters (input token, output token, amount, etc.), and it fetches this quote by calling the Jupiter /quote endpoint, which returns data in the form of an object called quoteResponse. Once a quote is fetched, the program then builds a transaction that it will submit to the blockchain (specifically submitting transactions to the Jito network currently). When building the transaction, the program further utilizes Jupiter by calling the /swap-instructions endpoint offered by Jupiter. The /swap-instructions endpoint accepts quoteResponse as input and generates a complete and ordered list of instructions that the program simply inserts into the transaction. \n\nHowever, the process of calling the /swap-instruction endpoint is responsible for over half of the latency produced by my program between fetching the quote and submitting the transaction to Jito. **I am trying to reduce this latency by creating a local tool that will run on my own machine that will mimic the function of the /swap-instruction endpoint but without the latency inherent with external RPC/API calls.** There is a lengthy amount of information that the tool would need to produce effective output. Most of this information can be retrieved from the quoteResponse or in other areas of the overall program, such as:\n\n- Automated Market Maker key: public key of relevant AMMs\n- Input Mint: Address of the origin token that I will be swapping out from\n- Output Mint: Address of the destination token that I will be swapping to\n- Input Amount: Amount of the origin token that I will be exchanging in the transaction\n- Output Amount: Amount of the destination token that I will be receiving in the transaction\n- Fee Amount: Amount of fees to be paid in the transaction (fees always paid in SOL)\n- DEX Label: Name of the DEX program ID involved in the transaction (examples are \"Raydium Concentrated Liquidity\" or \"Meteora DLMM Program\"\n- Slippage: The maximum change in token price (expressed as percentage in format \"0.05\" or \"0.1\" etc.) that the program is willing to except to still proceed with the transaction by the time it's submitted to Jito\n- Swap Mode: Parameter specific to Jupiter, by default i always choose \"ExactIn\" which means the program expects you to specify the exact amount of input token for the swap, then it will determine the output token amount after accounting for currency conversion and slippage and fees. Other option would be \"ExactOut\" where you specify the exact amount of output token you want from the transaction, and it will conversely determine all other parameters needed to satisfy that requirement\n- otherAmountThreshold: Parameter specific to Jupiter and I believe is paired with the Swap Mode Parameter, as this simply represents the minimum amount of the output token that you're willing to accept in the transaction, so another way of representing slippage, just as an exact number this time instead of a percentage as noted in the Swap Mode parameter\n- Input Token Decimals: Amount of decimals used in the formatting of the origin token\n- Output Token Decimals: Amount of decimals used in the formatting of the destination token\n\n\n\nAside from the information mentioned, there is also required information that can only be gathered through external RPC/API calls. For this, I would like a caching mechanism to store these parameters as they map to the other information in the tool, so that over time it will gradually eliminate the need for external RPC/API calls and can reference everything locally. The program implements this caching methodology for Address Lookup Tables currently, which has resulted in phenomenal latency improvements.",

The user opens the website at probspec.com and sees a classic homepage\n2. The user then clicks the \u201cGet Started\u201d button and navigates to a form where they answer questions and eventually specify their problem in text. \n3. An LLM may ask follow-up questions.\n4. At some point, some kind of database matching is triggered and the system suggests relevant problem-solving frameworks from the framework database (explained via LLM)\n5. The user chooses a relevant framework or specifies what they want. \n6. The system walks through an analysis, laying out a plan step by step and searching the web and/or using integrations to fill in data. For the MVP, this does not have to be fully baked. An LLM merely describing the relevant framework(s) and saying how it would proceed is more than enough for now.\n7. The system prepares a PDF or other type of summary. Again, for the demo this can be very minimal / proof-of-concept. \n8. The user can choose to keep requesting changes or do further analysis, creating some kind of internal memory or account. \n\nI have a wireframe UI and GitHub repo that I made using Lovable. I am enjoying using the service Lovable, which seems to have good integration with supabase for database back-end.\n\nHere is my plan for a ~7-day project:\n\n* Day 1: Spend a ~day of paid time just to get up to speed on the task, have an intro phone call\n* Day 2-3: Break down the project into definable sub-tasks and define an end goal. Get the core Github repo in clean shape for working and integrating all the different pieces\n* Day 4-7: Integrate LLM system with user interface and back-end database\n* Day 7-10: Testing and troubleshooting to get to MVP\n\nI am free daily for a 45 minute meeting anytime between 8am and 10 am US Pacific time.
